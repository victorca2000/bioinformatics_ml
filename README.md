# Genome-Derived Cancer Classifier
This project uses a dataset containing the genetic makeup of patients with either glioblastoma or breast cancer. The purpose of the project is to cluster the patients in a certain cancer type based on the level of genetic expression. 

The project includes the use of principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality, k-means clustering to group the observations, and both random forest and logistic regression to design a prediction model for whether a patient has brain or breast cancer. It also entails data visualization with the use of Python packages such as seaborn.

There are comments throughout the notebook to futher explain the code.
