This project uses a dataset containing the genetic makeup of patients with either glioblastoma or breast cancer. The purpose of the project is to cluster the patients in a certain cancer type based on the level of genetic expression. The project includes the use of principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality, k-means clustering to group the observations, and a logistic regression to design a prediction model for whether a patient has brain or breast cancer.
